I'm working in the Hibernate and Infinispan teams at Red Hat, caring about Lucene
integration in products we support, striving to make it easier to use and to
integrate in well known APIs and patterns, and finally to make it scale better;
I love clean and well performing code.
I've been an early adopter of cloud deployments scaling Lucene to a large number
of requests on Amazon EC2 using Hibernate Search, and after that I worked with
JIRA to make it clusterable via Infinispan.
I've lived in Holland, Italy, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Portugal and the UK;
love OSS and socializing with other developers to improve all and any OSS project.
