I'm honoured to confirm that I'll be at Devoxx UK this May in London.

Come along in _Gallery Hall_ at 12:55 on Thursday 11th of May to see a quick
demo of Hibernate OGM used to migrate a JPA application from using a relational
database to using a fast, scalable and highly available in memory data grid.

We announced support for http://in.relation.to/2017/03/02/hibernate-ogm-5-1-Final-released/[storing data in Infinispan over the Hot Rod protocol]
in Hibernate OGM version 5.1, now is your chance to see it in action.

My slot is a "tools in action" and we'll get straight to the point:
