With Maven Surefire playing tricks on us, we unfortunately missed a few regressions with the latest <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/Weld113FinalIsOut" target="" class="regularLink">1.1.3.Final</a> release.
</p>

Luckily Jozef spotted this early enough (too bad it wasn't before we actually did the release ;-), hopefully before you guys became grey of worry. :-)

So, the new Weld 1.1.3.SP1 is already in our JBoss Maven repo and on SourceForge as .zip.
