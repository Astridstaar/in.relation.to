I am ending my day totally exhausted but happy.
Today we organised Red Hat 4 Kids in the Red Hat France office.

Every year at Red Hat, we organise a Red Hat Week to celebrate our culture.
And in good open source community way, each local office declines how it pleases this event.
This year, I proposed to do a http://www.devoxx4kids.org[Devoxx4Kids] for the children of French Red Hatters.

Red Hat 4 Kids (aka a copy paste of Devoxx 4 Kids) initiates children from 6 to 12+ to the notion of programming.
Sharing our knowledge to teach them what daddy or mummy does. Sounds cool.

I knew it was doable since the awesome Devoxx4Kids team has successfully declined these events around the world.
But my engineering spider-senses told me it would be quite a humongous task.
I was right but it's one of those projects where you need to jump first and think later.

== What did we do?

For the 6 to 10 years old boys and girls, we have done a http://scratch.mit.edu[Scratch workshop].
Scratch is awesome, it has all the basics of programming: blocks, loops, conditions, events, event sharing, etc...
Here, not need to prepare much, explain the basics and let the kids go (see below).

For the 10+ kids, we have done the Arduino workshop: programming electronics for the win :)
We have reused the Devoxx4Kids one verbatim.

We were also lucky to have the https://www.aldebaran.com[Aldebaran] team with us.
So the kids moved up from the basics of programming to full https://www.aldebaran.com/en/humanoid-robot/nao-robot[Nao] robot programming.
Nao is a serious guest start and actually easier to program than Scratch :)

== What are the challenges?

You need to prepare everything material wise::
We installed a fresh Fedora 22 on all laptops to get everything set up the same:
this really helped as we did not have to fight different environments.
To be safe, we used ethernet and not WiFi: some WiFi routers don't enjoy too many laptops at once.

Don't go too long::
For the 6-10 years old, they started to slowly drift after one hour.
Don't go over 1h30 per workshops and do breaks between them.
For the 10+, they actullally went beyond our 1h30 and chose coding over cakes: success!

Limit the introduction and slides as much as possible::
Developers don't like slides.
It turns out kids disregard them after 4 mins top.
I had to cut the presentation quickly and instead...

Do customized assistance::
Show them by pair-kid-programming how to do the basic things and
let them do what they want: help them achieve their goal:
story, adventure, games etc...
One grown up for one to two laptops, two kids per laptops. Max.
They will be much more engaged.

== Special thanks

It's quite a special feeling to see a good chunk of the kids being that engaged,
asking tougher and tougher questions over time and preferring coding to cakes.

I have many people to thank for this project.
Hopefully I won't forget too many of them:

* the Devoxx4Kids team for putting their workshop in open source
* Audrey and Arun from Devoxx4Kids for giving me customized advice and reassuring me along the way
* the Red Hat French facilities team for saying _yes_ to this project and putting up with all the material challenges (room size, power outlets, laptop hunt, mouse chasing, etc.)
* the local Red Hat techies for gathering the hardware, installing the machines, testing everything and helping out during the workshops
* last be not least, the Aldebaran team for being part of the fun

== Just Fracking do it

Don't think, do it.
Go to http://devoxx4kids.org and start from their workshops.
