A while back https://twitter.com/alrubinger/status/718527667268505600[this tweet] was posted by Andrew Lee Rubinger
about merge commits. It started a nice discussion which we last week sat down and try put into podcast form.

And here it is - Emmanuel, Andrew and I talking about merge vs rebase, tab vs spaces and other things in the realm
of git workflows.

Episode 42 - http://jbosscommunityasylum.libsyn.com/podcast-42-i-git-your-flow[Show notes and podcast].

Enjoy!
