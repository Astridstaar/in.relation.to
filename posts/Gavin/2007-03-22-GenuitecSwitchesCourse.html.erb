Wow, amazing how quickly my last blog entry got results!
Since I posted it, it appears that Genuitec have decided
to comply with the LGPL and provide their modifications
to Hibernate tools in source form:

I don't know why it had to take 1.5 years for them to take 
this step.

<p class="wikiPara">
Of course, rather than apologizing for the <q>oversight</q>, Maher
writes yet another silly and this time dishonest blog, 
blaming us for Genuitec's noncompliance. Whatever - I'm sure
some people will believe his version of the story, but 
some people will believe anything :-)

We'll take a look at what has been released today, and 
hopefully this is the end of this sorry episode.

Amazing what a 'lil bit of good old fashioned public shaming 
could accomplish that 1.5 years worth of friendly private 
approaches could not.

UPDATE: Ups! Max thinks some stuff is missing from the source
bundle. He's digging a bit deeper. We'll keep you up to date
on how this news evolves ;-)
