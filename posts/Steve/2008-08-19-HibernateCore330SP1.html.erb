3.3.0.GA got released the other day with an uncaught problem.  A public method got removed from some of the events (specifically <tt>PreInsertEvent</tt> and <tt>PreUpdateEvent</tt>) which is causing problems with Hibernate Validator and which will probably cause problems for any applications utilizing custom listeners for those events.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Therefore, later today I will be releasing 3.3.0.SP1 to correct that oversight.  I apologize for any inconveniences.
