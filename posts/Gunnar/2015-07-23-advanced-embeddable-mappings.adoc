= Map me if you can  - Advanced embeddable mappings

The other day I came across an interesting mapping challenge which I thought may be worth sharing. If you are a seasoned JPA user, it will probably be nothing new to you, but those not as experienced may find it helpful :)

TL;DR - JPA let's you override database columns for embedded objects but also for collections of embedded objects; `@AttributeOverride` and `@AssocationOverride` can be used for that.

Let's assume the following entity model representing a person and their home and business address:

image::class_diagram_element_collection.png["Entity model",align="center"]

The interesting part is that `Person` has two associations with `Address`, one with the "homeAddress" role and another one with the "businessAddress" role. `Address` in turn has one ore more address lines.

When mapping these types with JPA, `Person` naturally becomes an entity. As there is a composition relationship between `Person` and `Address`, the latter is mapped with `@Embeddable`. The same goes for `AddressLine`, which also is an `@Embeddable`, contained within an element collection owned by `Address`.

So you'd end up with these classes:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private long id;
    private String name;
    private Address homeAddress;
    private Address businessAddress;

    // constructor, getters and setters...
}
----
[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class Address {

    private boolean active;

    @ElementCollection
    private List<AddressLine> lines = new ArrayList<AddressLine>();

    // constructor, getters and setters...
}
----
[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class AddressLine {

    private String value;

    // constructor, getters and setters...
}
----

== `@AttributeOverride`

Let's fire up a session factory with these types (this uses the brand-new bootstrapping API coming in Hibernate ORM 5) and see how that goes:

[source,java]
----
StandardServiceRegistry registry = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder()
    .applySetting( AvailableSettings.SHOW_SQL, true )
    .applySetting( AvailableSettings.FORMAT_SQL, true )
    .applySetting( AvailableSettings.HBM2DDL_AUTO, "create-drop" )
    .build();

SessionFactory sessionFactory = new MetadataSources( registry )
    .addAnnotatedClass( Person.class )
    .buildMetadata()
    .buildSessionFactory();
----

Hum, that did not go too well:

[source,java]
----
org.hibernate.MappingException: Repeated column in mapping for entity:
org.hibernate.bugs.Person column: active (should be mapped with insert="false" update="false")
----

Of course this makes sense; As `Address` is embedded twice within `Person`, its properties must be mapped to unique column names within the `Person` table. The http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/index.html?javax/persistence/AttributeOverride.html[@AttributeOverride] annotation can be used for that:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private long id;
    private String name;

    @AttributeOverride(name = "active", column = @Column(name = "home_address_active"))
    private Address homeAddress;

    @AttributeOverride(name = "active", column = @Column(name = "business_address_active"))
    private Address businessAddress;

    // constructor, getters and setters...
}
----

With that, the session factory boots successfully. But let's take a look at the tables that get created:

[source,sql]
----
create table Person (
    id bigint not null,
    business_address_active boolean,
    home_address_active boolean,
    name varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
)

create table Person_lines (
    Person_id bigint not null,
    "value" varchar(255)
)
----

== `@AssociationOverride`

The `Person` table looks alright, but there is only a single table for the address lines. That's a problem as it means there is no way to tell apart the lines of the business address from the lines of the home address when reading back a person from the database.

So what to do? `@AttributeOverride` is of no help this time, as it's not a single column which needs to be re-defined but an entire table. But luckily, `@AttributeOverride` has a companion, http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/index.html?javax/persistence/AssociationOverride.html[@AssociationOverride]. This annotation can be used to configure the required tables in this case:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private long id;
    private String name;

    @AttributeOverride(name = "active", column = @Column(name = "home_address_active"))
    @AssociationOverride(name = "lines", joinTable = @JoinTable(name = "Person_HomeAddress_Line"))
    private Address homeAddress;

    @AttributeOverride(name = "active", column = @Column(name = "business_address_active"))
    @AssociationOverride(name = "lines", joinTable = @JoinTable(name = "Person_BusinessAddress_Line"))
    private Address businessAddress;

    // constructor, getters and setters...
}
----

Et voil√†, now you'll get the DDL for creating the `Person` table and two different tables for the address lines:

[source,java]
----
create table Person (
    id bigint not null,
    business_address_active boolean,
    home_address_active boolean,
    name varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
)

create table Person_BusinessAddress_Line (
    Person_id bigint not null,
    "value" varchar(255)
)

create table Person_HomeAddress_Line (
    Person_id bigint not null,
    "value" varchar(255)
)
