There has been a lot of release activity on the Hibernate front lately and it is my pleasure to announce that Hibernate Validator just joined the party with the release of Hibernate Validator 5.3.0.Final.

== What's new since 5.3.0.CR1

5.3.0.CR1 was a candidate release so we did not change much!

Marco Davi http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39872625/type-use-annotation-in-hibernate-validator[reported on Stackoverflow] that the property path generated for type arguments constraints could be improved so we fixed it. You should now be able to exploit type arguments constraints violations more easily.

Ahmed Al Hafoudh contributed a translation for Slovak for our default messages.

You can find the complete list of all addressed issues in the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/blob/5.3.0.Final/changelog.txt[change log].

== Hey! I missed the previous announcements!

If you missed what we already announced for 5.3.0, the most important changes are:

 * Dynamic payloads for constraints
 * A new programmatic API for constraint definition and declaration

Please consult the announcements for more information:

 * http://in.relation.to/2016/09/05/hibernate-validator-530-cr1-out/[Hibernate Validator 5.3.0.CR1 announcement]
 * http://in.relation.to/2016/01/18/hibernate-validator-530-alpha1-out/[Hibernate Validator 5.3.0.Alpha1 announcement]

== Getting the release

Hibernate Validator 5.3.0.Final should be a drop-in replacement in most cases. Please consult https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateValidatorMigrationGuide[our migration guide] before upgrading your application to 5.3.0.Final.

To get the release with Maven, Gradle etc. use the GAV coordinates _org.hibernate:{hibernate-validator|hibernate-validator-cdi|hibernate-validator-annotation-processor}:5.3.0.Final_.

Alternatively, a distribution bundle containing all the bits is provided on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/5.3.0.Final/hibernate-validator-5.3.0.Final-dist.tar.gz/download[TAR.GZ], http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/5.3.0.Final/hibernate-validator-5.3.0.Final-dist.zip/download[ZIP]).

To get in touch, use the following channels:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate-validator[hibernate-validator tag on Stackoverflow] (usage questions)
* https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=31[User forum] (usage questions, general feedback)
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV[Issue tracker] (bug reports, feature requests)
* http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/hibernate-dev/[Mailing list] (development-related discussions)

== What's next?

We are going to prepare a 5.4 release with support for javax.money validation contributed by Lukas Niemeier and Willi Sch√∂nborn from Zalando and a lot of improvements to the annotation processor thanks to the great work of Marko Bekhta.

We are actively working on Bean Validation 2.0 and Hibernate Validator 6 with a strong focus on supporting Java 8 new features (and much more!). The more the merrier, so feel free to join us: drop ideas, comment on others' proposals, now is the time to define the future of Bean Validation. You can find all the necessary information on the http://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation website].
