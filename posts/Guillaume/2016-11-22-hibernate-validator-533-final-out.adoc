== A bugfix version for modular environments

Disclaimer: if you are not using a modular environment such as WildFly or OSGi, this release will probably be of little interest to you. But you can read this post anyway!

We are in the process of upgrading the Hibernate Validator version shipped with the WildFly application server. This 5.3.3.Final release is here to fix a bug exposed in the very flexible modular environment of WildFly.

If you have followed what we did for the http://in.relation.to/2016/10/27/hibernate-validator-531-final-out/[5.3.1.Final] and the http://in.relation.to/2016/11/10/hibernate-validator-532-final-out/[5.3.2.Final] releases, you know that we changed the way the `javax.el.ExpressionFactory` was managed. For the better.

But by doing so, we exposed a very well hidden bug in some specific WildFly environments. After some very fun class loading debugging, we ended up with a solution that fixes the issue at hand and also improves the user experience in OSGi environments.

You can find the complete list of all addressed issues (well, of the addressed issue) in the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/blob/5.3.3.Final/changelog.txt[change log].

== Getting the release

Hibernate Validator 5.3.3.Final is a drop-in replacement of Hibernate Validator 5.3.2.Final.

To get the release with Maven, Gradle etc. use the GAV coordinates _org.hibernate:{hibernate-validator|hibernate-validator-cdi|hibernate-validator-annotation-processor}:5.3.3.Final_.

Alternatively, a distribution bundle containing all the bits is provided on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/5.3.3.Final/hibernate-validator-5.3.3.Final-dist.tar.gz/download[TAR.GZ], http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/5.3.3.Final/hibernate-validator-5.3.3.Final-dist.zip/download[ZIP]).

== What's next?

We are going to prepare a 5.4 release with support for javax.money validation contributed by Lukas Niemeier and Willi Sch√∂nborn from Zalando and a lot of improvements to the annotation processor thanks to the great work of Marko Bekhta.

We are actively working on Bean Validation 2.0 and Hibernate Validator 6 with a strong focus on supporting the new features of Java 8 (and much more!). The more the merrier, so feel free to join us: drop ideas, comment on others' proposals, now is the time to define the future of Bean Validation. You can find all the necessary information on the http://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation website].
