A very handy feature when working with JDBC batch updates is to find out which statement triggered a batch failure.
Read https://vladmihalcea.com/2017/03/21/how-to-find-which-statement-failed-in-a-jdbc-batch-update/[this article] for more info on this topic.

You can use Hibernate with CockroachDB. Check out https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb-hibernate.html[this tutorial] to see how easily you can integrate them.

Mapping the `@OneToMany` association is not as easy as you might think.
Check out this article which shows you https://vladmihalcea.com/2017/03/29/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-association-with-jpa-and-hibernate/[the best way to map a `@OneToMany` relationship].

Alon Segal shows you how to implement https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-hibernate-multitenancy-implementation[Multitenancy with Spring and Hibernate].
Multitenancy is very handy when you need to support multiple customers on a single platform so that each customer is limited to its own tenant.

I read http://www.codesod.com/2017/03/dealing-with-javas-localdatetime-in-jpa.html[this article] which describes a way to provide
a JPA `AttributeConverter` to support Java 1.8 Data/Time types. However, this is not needed since Hibernate has been supported them for quite a while now.

For our Czech readers, Roman Pichl√≠k wrote http://www.dagblog.cz/2017/03/papirova-skalovatelnost-bcrypt-ladeni.html[a very good article] about all sorts of application performance issues,
and the Open-Session in View is mentioned as well.

For our French readers, eXo platform has written https://www.exoplatform.com/blog/fr/2017/03/28/developper-avec-jpa-et-exo-platform[an article] that shows you how to integrate eXO with JPA and Hibernate.
