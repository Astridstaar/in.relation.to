== Hi, Lukas. Would you like to introduce yourself?

Hi Vlad, I'm https://twitter.com/lukaseder[@lukaseder], founder and CEO of Data Geekery, the company behind https://www.jooq.org/[jOOQ].
I am a Java Champion and Oracle ACE, and I will surely get all the other cool
badges from the other vendors as well, soon. I have millions of Stack
Overflow reputation, reddit karma, and other important Internet points,
and I was recently endorsed on LinkedIn not only for XML, but also for
Microsoft Excel reactive programming - the only tool even more powerful
than SQL.

Apart from those remarkable accomplishments ;), I'm mostly coding and
tuning Java, SQL, and PL/SQL around jOOQ and for customers of Data
Geekery's consultancy services. I'm also delivering public and
in-house https://www.jooq.org/training[SQL trainings], and I'm generally
trying to make the lives of Java developers who work with SQL easier.

You can meet me at conferences where I talk about
the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTPGW1PNy_Y[awesomeness of SQL] to
those poor souls whose enterprise software architects coerce them to
write business logic in a
non-SQL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-generation_programming_language[3GL] -
or those weird developers who choose to do so on their own. Come see my
talks, you will see the light!

== I always wanted to know how jOOQ was born. Can you tell us how it all started? 

The _spirit_ of jOOQ was born in the early 1800s when Ada Lovelace
essentially invented programming. She surely would have predicted it.
Once algorithms were a thing, the world was now ready for SQL, and thus
for jOOQ. After her impressive work, however, many detours were taken,
and it took another 150 years until the invention of SQL, and roughly,
until 2009, when it became clear that SQL has to be part of Java as
well. Thus: jOOQ. 

When focusing only on the 2009 bit of history, jOOQ happened "by
accident". At the time, in essence, everyone was creating home-grown
query builders to abstract away the pain of concatenating the strings "A
= 1" and "B = 2", connecting them with " AND ", and occasionally, with "
OR ". Overall global efforts invested in that area can only be measured
in terms of geologic time scales ("person-eons"). Those efforts all went
to waste because even within the same company, several teams made the
same efforts again and again.

Most of these in-house tools could roughly handle SELECT .. FROM ..
WHERE. JOINs were hardly supported (or even understood), and if you
added GROUP BY to the mix, there was a Cambrian explosion of bugs,
patches, and further person-eons of maintenance work.

All this meant that there had to be an industry need, a market, for a
tool that everyone can use. A tool to make sure this problem of building
SQL strings will be solved for good. And there were such tools! At the
time, there were at least 10 proof-of-concept style open source
libraries, and perhaps one that took it a step further called QueryDSL.
But none of them went "all in" on the SQL language. Again, most of them
handled SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE, and then pretty much stopped at that.

jOOQ _had_ to be made and stay here for good.

== When it comes to persisting and fetching data, what's the approach taken by jOOQ? How does it compare to the transactional write-behind one employed by Hibernate?

jOOQ is "just" typesafe JDBC/SQL, i.e. it is an API that allows its
users to write SQL, not as strings (as with JDBC), but as compile-time
type checked SQL expression trees that just happen to look an awful lot
like actual SQL. So, the question isn't really what the approach for
persisting and fetching data, but for writing the queries to do so.

You could compare jOOQ with JPA's Criteria Query API, which is "just"
typesafe JPA/JPQL - although I must say that Criteria Query could have
been better executed. Writing an internal DSL (Domain-Specific Language)
is really hard. The implications in terms of API maintenance and keeping
Backward Compatibility are very tricky. I think Criteria Query was
added to the JPA specification prematurely. Now that we have it, it can
never really be changed, only, perhaps, superseded.

Now, if you want to compare the approaches of writing queries (SQL,
JDBC, jOOQ, JPA native queries) vs the "transactional write-behind"
approach (JPA, Hibernate, other ORMs), the discussion gets a bit more
complex, and not strictly tool related, but architecture related.

In short, the SQL approach is more bulk data processing oriented (for
both reads and writes), whereas the JPA approach is more CRUD oriented.
SQL is more stateless/sessionless/side-effect free whereas JPA is
stateful/"sessionful"/imperative. SQL runs set based computational
logic in the database, giving access to the sophistication of modern SQL
optimisers, whereas JPA offers running record based computational logic
in the client, giving access to the vast possibilities of Java libraries
and client-side processing.

So, clearly, the two things represent not just different technologies,
but different paradigms and mindsets.

However, this still doesn't explain _why_ each approach could be the
preferred one in a given situation. And it's a really tricky question. I
have personally only ever worked with systems where the SQL approach was
clearly more advantageous (large data sets, thousands of tables, dozens
of joins needed per query, thousands of concurrent queries, thousands of
stored procedures, few concurrent writes, mixed OLTP and OLAP workloads)
- but I know many people and their systems, where pure SQL would be
detrimental for the complex transactional patterns they employ and JPA
really shines.

Ideally, there's a mix of both worlds: SQL and JPA - or jOOQ and
Hibernate, which are concrete implementations. Because ultimately, one
size never fits all, and you _will_ have reporting and analytics (SQL)
in an OLTP/CRUD (JPA) application, to give a simple example.

Of course, https://blog.jooq.org/2015/03/24/jooq-vs-hibernate-when-to-choose-which/[I have blogged about this in the past].

== How easy it would be to integrate jOOQ and Hibernate and what would be the main benefit of combining both frameworks?

There are different ways to integrate.

*Integrating query API*

From a mere API perspective, it is very easy. As of jOOQ 3.10, you can
simply extract any SQL string and bind variable sets directly from your
jOOQ query, send that query to the Hibernate/JPA native query API, and
let Hibernate sort out the mapping according to JPA standards. This
works with:

- mapping ordinary native queries to `Object[]` record representations
- mapping "enriched" native queries to `@SqlResultSetMapping` specifications
- mapping ordinary native queries to entities

Specifically, the latter can be quite powerful. Sometimes, you _do_ want
to get managed entities as a result, but you cannot express the
complexity of your query in a JPQL query/Criteria Query/named entity
graph. Simple examples involve using unions, common table expressions,
derived tables, lateral joins, and many other features that are not well
supported in JPQL. 

In that case, SQL shines, and from a performance and maintainability
perspective, it is almost always the better option compared to fetching
all data into memory and implementing the logic in Java. All you have to
do is make sure you select all the columns needed for the entity graph
that you want to materialize, possibly using
some https://vladmihalcea.com/why-you-should-use-the-hibernate-resulttransformer-to-customize-result-set-mappings/[Hibernate-specific
`ResultTransformer`] (look who wrote about that topic ;) ), and you're
done.

https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-execution/alternative-execution-models/using-jooq-with-jpa/[Examples
for the above can be seen in the jOOQ manual].

A future jOOQ version, hopefully, version 3.11 (for workgroups ;), will
further simplify the integration by binding the jOOQ SPIs directly to an
`EntityManager`. This will remove the need for extracting SQL strings and
bind variables from jOOQ queries and allow for executing the query
directly using jOOQ API but on the `EntityManager`. I'm really looking
forward to this feature, which makes using the best of both worlds
really simple.

*Integrating code generation*

Another cool integration point is the jOOQ code generation based off JPA
annotated entities, with Hibernate being used behind the scenes. Many
projects already use Hibernate and want to run a couple of reports or
entity queries with SQL, and thus with jOOQ. They can now
reverse-engineer the JPA annotated entities using Hibernate, generate an
in-memory H2 database from them, and jOOQ can read that H2 database to
generate jOOQ code.

Even if I personally prefer working with DDL, many projects see their
JPA annotated entities as their primary source of schema information, so
that approach suits them really well.

https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/code-generation/codegen-jpa/[This
feature is documented here].

*Integrating on a JDBC level*

A lesser-known integration point is the fact that jOOQ exposes itself
through at least two low-level, JDBC-based SPIs:

- the parser API
- the mocking API

In both cases, jOOQ can proxy a JDBC Connection and do things like:

- Parsing the SQL string that gets sent to jOOQ and transforming the SQL
expression tree to something else, e.g. by applying a VisitListener.
This could be used to
implement https://blog.jooq.org/2015/06/17/implementing-client-side-row-level-security-with-jooq/[client-side row-level security], or sophisticated multi-tenancy, or other
things. Also, the parsed SQL string can be translated to other SQL
dialects (although that is not really useful in Hibernate, which is
already dialect agnostic). A future jOOQ version will be able to apply
custom formatting to arbitrary SQL strings, so this could work nicely as
a formatting utility for Hibernate-generated SQL, for logging purposes.

- The https://blog.jooq.org/2013/02/20/easy-mocking-of-your-database/[SQL
statement can be mocked through a single SPI], returning "fake" results
in some cases. In simple setups, this can be quite powerful to intercept
queries both for testing and for other purposes.

Again, these features do not expose jOOQ to the client, but hide jOOQ
behind JDBC, so that they can work with JDBC directly, or with Hibernate.

== For many Java developers, the level of knowledge of SQL is rather basic. What awesome SQL features would you recommend Java developers to start learning more about? 

That's true, very unfortunately. I would recommend this:

. First off, don't be afraid of SQL. SQL is a very simple functional
programming language that just happens to have a rather quirky, arcane
syntax. THE MORE YOU YELL, THE FASTER IT RUNS, RIGHT?
(https://twitter.com/shipilev/status/703176579191410689[Credit for this
joke to Aleksey Shipilëv]). But in order to truly understand SQL (both
basic _and_ sophisticated SQL), I think it is important to remember
where it came
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra[Relational
Algebra]. If this is properly understood, in particular, the fact that
most operations are just syntax sugar over basic set operations like set
unions and cartesian products, then the language will make a lot more
sense, and it becomes clear how powerful it really is.
. Then, I suggest reading this https://blog.jooq.org/sql[really cool
blog about SQL] ;) and looking out for a couple of more advanced
features. The most important ones are common table expressions (CTE) and
window functions. CTE is super easy to understand and will add value
immediately when writing complex queries. Window functions are a bit
more tricky, but I'd say also much more rewarding on an everyday basis.
Once these are understood, a vast number of other features are worth
visiting. Sophisticated examples are shown on my post
https://blog.jooq.org/2016/04/25/10-sql-tricks-that-you-didnt-think-were-possible/["10SQL Tricks That You Didn't Think Were Possible"], but there are many
other, simpler features that can be used on a daily basis. I will cover
more of them on the blog in the future, I'm also writing a book (this
does take longer than expected, with 2 kids...), and of course, these
topics are covered in my https://www.jooq.org/training[SQL training].

== We always value feedback from our community,  so can you tell us what features you'd like us to add to make easier for other data access frameworks to integrate with JPA or Hibernate?

I know we've discussed the fact that the existing `ResultTransformer` SPI
will be improved in Hibernate 6.0. This is probably one of the most
interesting SPIs for other data access frameworks, like jOOQ. I hope the
new version will be standardized in JPA and allow for really easy custom
transformation between flat result sets and entity graphs.`
 
From my perspective, I've always wondered why popular ORMs like
Hibernate do everything in a single tool, mostly:

- the modeling part
- the mapping part
- the querying part
- the session/cache management part

If these parts could be split into different and independent JPA/Hibernate modules, the whole toolchain could be even more powerful. For
instance, if there was a Hibernate mapping library that cares only about
how to map between flat data and annotated entity graphs (but wouldn't
worry about managing such entities, or about fetching them, as that
would belong to the session/cache management part, or the querying
part), that would be really useful.
