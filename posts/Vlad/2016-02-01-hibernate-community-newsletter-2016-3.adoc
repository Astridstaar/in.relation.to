Starting this year, we are hosting http://in.relation.to/2016/01/04/hibernate-community-newsletter-2016-1/[a series of articles] focused on the Hibernate community.
We share blog posts, forum and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

Eugen Paraschiv wrote a very detailed article about http://www.baeldung.com/database-auditing-jpa[auditing entity changes], comparing JPA callback annotations with Hibernate Envers and Spring Data JPA Auditing.

The guys at Plumbr have raised awareness of how the https://plumbr.eu/blog/io/how-we-accidentally-doubled-our-jdbc-traffic-with-hibernate[MySQL JDBC driver handles database-generated warning messages].
We created a https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10484[JIRA issue] for this, and we're discussing various possibilities for handling it without affecting other database drivers which are more efficient in this regard.

I wrote an https://vladmihalcea.com/how-does-jpa-and-hibernate-define-the-auto-flush-mode/[article about the `AUTO` flush mode handling strategies] employed by the Hibernate implementation of the Java Persistence API and the Hibernate native API.

http://wildfly.org/news/2016/01/29/WildFly10-Released/[WildFly 10] has just been released with support for Hibernate 5.

== Videos

Thorben Janssen recorded a http://www.thoughts-on-java.org/free-sample-lecture-hibernate-1st-level-cache/[video] explaining the first-level cache.
