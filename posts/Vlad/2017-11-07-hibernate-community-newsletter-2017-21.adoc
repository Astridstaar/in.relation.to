Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

Marko Bekhta, the https://twitter.com/that_java_guy[@that_java_guy on Twitter] has written a very good series of articles
about JPA and Hibernate:

- http://that-java-guy.blogspot.ro/2017/10/jpa-ways-to-map-many-to-many.html[Ways to map JPA many-to-many relationships with additional information]
- http://that-java-guy.blogspot.ro/2017/05/jpa-mapping-enums-right-way.html[Mapping JPA Enums the right way]
- http://that-java-guy.blogspot.ro/2017/11/jpa-handy-utility-for-enums-to-combine.html[A handy utility to combine Enums with the JPA AttributeConverter]

Although JPA is a very mature standard, Hibernate still offers many additions
that you could definitely benefit from.

One such example is the `@NaturalId` annotation which,
not only it allows you to map business keys on the entity level, but you can even
https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-naturalid-business-key-with-jpa-and-hibernate/[fetch the entity by its natural identifier without even hitting the database].

Eugen Paraschiv, who runs the well-known http://www.baeldung.com[Baeldung] website,
has written two articles about Hibernate:

- http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-dynamic-mapping[Dynamic Mapping with Hibernate]
- http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-date-time[Hibernate â€“ Mapping Date and Time]

The Hibernate Validator team has put up a new benchmark to compare the following Bean Validation implementation:

- Hibernate Validator 6.0.4.Final (released on the 25th of October 2017)

- Hibernate Validator 5.4.2.Final (released on the 19th of October 2017)

- Apache BVal 1.1.2 (released on the 3rd of November 2016)

In the true spirit of open-source software development,
the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/tree/master/performance[JMH benchmarks are available on GitHub],
so you can also run them yourself if you want.

For more details about the benchmark and the results we've got, check out
http://in.relation.to/2017/10/31/bean-validation-benchmark-revisited/[this article].

If you want to play with Hibernate Validator, there is even
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-demos/tree/master/hibernate-validator/javafx-validation-example[a JavaFX example]
application that you can use to test this framework.

https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-tips-call-postgresql-function/[This article]
shows you a how you can call a PostgreSQL function from JPA.

For more details about how to call stored procedures and functions that can return both scalar (simple basic types)
and even `REFCURSOR`, which allows you to return table data as a `ResultSet`, then you should definitely read the following articles:
