Starting this year, we are hosting a series of articles focused on the Hibernate community.
We share blog posts, forum and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== News

We are happy that http://in.relation.to/2016/02/10/hibernate-orm-510-final-release/[Hibernate 5.1] is ready.
The new User Guide still needs a few site-related changes in order to make the switch, so stay tuned!
