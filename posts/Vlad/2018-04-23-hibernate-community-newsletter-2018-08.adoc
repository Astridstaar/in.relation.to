Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are
especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

A very good resource especially for beginners, https://www.theserverside.com/tip/How-JPA-and-Hibernate-simplify-data-persistence[this article]
shows you how JPA and Hibernate simplify data persistence.

When using JPA and Hibernate, it is very important to log the statements that are auto-generated on your behalf.
If you are using Spring Boot, check out http://www.baeldung.com/sql-logging-spring-boot[this article] for more details about enabling SQL statement logging.

A very good addition to the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver, the `reWriteBatchedInserts` configuration property allows you to optimize the processing of batched statements on the
database side. For more details, check out https://vladmihalcea.com/postgresql-multi-row-insert-rewritebatchedinserts-property/[this article].

If you want to use Hibernate with SAP HANA on Google Cloud Platform, then
https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/09/building-translytical-applications-using-hibernate-sap-hana-and-google/[this tutorial]
provides a very good introduction about how you can build translytical applications.

If you're using PostgreSQL with JPA and Hibernate, these
https://vladmihalcea.com/9-postgresql-high-performance-performance-tips/[9 High-Performance Tips]
will surely help you speed up your data access layer.

Iif you want to use Spring Boot to build an application that uses Hibernate to persist data into Oracle
http://programmergate.com/spring-boot-jpa-hibernate-oracle/[this tutorial] will provide a step-by-step guide for how to achieve this goal.

Most often, a JPA is mapped to a one database table. Nevertheless, you can also map https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-lazy-load-entity-attributes-using-jpa-and-hibernate/[multiple entities to the same database table] or https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-tips-how-to-map-an-entity-to-multiple-tables/[an entity to multiple tables].

== Time to upgrade
