== Looking for your feedback

We are looking for your feedback in about Hibernate bootstrap in cloud environments.
Check out http://in.relation.to/2017/02/16/hibernate-connections-cloud/[this article for more details].
If you have any idea or proposal, don't hesitate to use the comments section below the aforementioned article.

== Articles

Sometimes, it's easy to miss the basic concepts, and relational databases are no different. Check out this article about https://vladmihalcea.com/how-does-a-relational-database-work/[how does a relational database work].

Check out http://in.relation.to/2017/02/13/building-multi-release-jars-with-maven/[how you can build Multi-Release JARs with Maven and Java 9]. This is an awesome tip!

We released http://in.relation.to/2017/02/16/mariadb-dialects/[dedicated Dialects for MariaDB], so you don't have to use the MySQL-specific Dialects when working with MariaDB.

Integration testing is of paramount importance when building an enterprise application. However, many projects rely on in-memory databases (e.g. H2, HSQLDB) for testing,
while in production they use Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL or MySQL.
In https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-run-integration-tests-at-warp-speed-with-docker-and-tmpfs/[this article], you'll find how you can run integration tests faster using tmpfs and Docker.

Check out this https://rjbtechnology.com/blog/2017-01/discriminator-multitenancy-with-spring-and-hibernate-no-filters/[very ingenious solution to discriminator-based Multitenancy suing Hibernate Filters].

If you're using JCache through Spring, Hibernate, and Ehcache, http://blog.tremblay.pro/2017/02/jcache.html[this article explains how you can prevent spontaneous cache creation].

Concurrency Control is a very tricky subject.
Check out https://vladmihalcea.com/how-does-database-pessimistic-locking-interact-with-insert-update-and-delete-sql-statements/[this article about how explicit pessimistic locking interacts with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements].

Emmanouil Gkatziouras wrote two articles about Hibernate and Hazelcast as a 2nd-level caching provider:

* https://egkatzioura.wordpress.com/2017/02/12/hibernate-caching-with-hazelcast-basics/[A basic Hibernate Caching configuration when using Hazelcast]

Russ Thomas wrote https://sqljudo.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/what-every-dba-and-swe-should-know-about-ef/[a comprehensive list of ORM Anti-Patterns.
Although the article was written for Entity Framework, the tups apply to JPA or Hibernate.

For our Portuguese readers, Rhuan Henrique Rocha da Silva wrote an article about https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/EntendendoMappedByDoHibernate[the meaning of `mappedBy` in JPA and Hibernate].

Thorben Janssen wrote an article about http://www.thoughts-on-java.org/add-full-text-search-application-hibernate-search/[adding Full-Test Search capabilities to a Hibernate application].

Paul Klingelhuber wrote an article about https://medium.com/@paul.klingelhuber/hibernate-dirty-checking-with-converted-attributes-1b6d1cd27f68#.wtp2qvu05[how the Dirty Checking mechanism interacts with JPA AttributeConverters].

I also wrote an article https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-map-the-latest-child-of-a-parent-entity-using-hibernate-joinformula/[how to map the latest child of a parent entity using Hibernate `@JoinFormula`].
