== Hi, Jonathan. Would you like to introduce yourself?

Hi Vlad. Thanks for having me. My name is Jonathan Bregler. I’m a
software developer working at SAP in Walldorf, Germany.

I started out as a Java developer working on projects with various open
source components, such as Spring, Tomcat, OSGi, CXF, and of course
Hibernate. I’ve always been interested in databases and how to use them
efficiently, which is why I’ve been fascinated by Hibernate from the
very beginning.

Since I wanted to know more about the internal workings of databases and
get some hands-on experience, I joined SAP as part of their SAP HANA
development team. Over the past few years, I’ve been working on several
aspects of the SAP HANA database, such as software logistics, porting
the database to IBM PowerPC, and the SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure.

Last year, I got the opportunity to help improve the support for SAP
HANA in popular Java open source frameworks such as Hibernate. Given my
background, this opportunity seemed tailor-made for me, so I took it and
never looked back.

== Can you tell us how SAP HANA works and how it differs from other database systems?

SAP HANA differs from most other databases in that it’s an in-memory
columnar database. This unique design enables the processing of
transactional and analytical workloads at the same time, thus making SAP
HANA a true
https://blogs.saphana.com/2018/01/03/we-know-data-we-know-platforms-lets-talk-translytics/[translytical
data platform. Here are some benefits that SAP HANA] offers.

=== In-memory, columnar, massively parallel database processing

The SAP HANA platform permits online transaction processing and online
analytical processing workloads using a single data copy on a single
platform.

It stores data in high-speed memory, organizes it in columns,
and partitions and distributes it among multiple servers. This delivers
faster queries that aggregate data more efficiently while avoiding
costly full-table scans, materialized views, and analytic indexes.

=== Data modeling and stored procedures

SAP HANA offers a native language called SQLScript that lets you build
stored procedures and use advanced capabilities to build complex logic
that runs inside the database.

It includes a business function library
with built-in parameter-driven financial functions. In addition, it also
includes a framework that lets you build custom algorithms and run them
securely inside the database. Core data services, graphical calculation
views, and decision tables further simplify and accelerate the creation
of database logic.

=== Spatial processing

SAP HANA provides native support for spatial data and spatial functions.
Spatial processing is supported by SQL through Open Geospatial
Consortium standards, International Standards Organization rules for
multimedia and application-specific packages (ISO SQL/MM), and
geospatial JavaScript Open Notation (GeoJSON) standards to store, query,
and access location-enabled content.

The use of open standards lets you
exchange spatial information with third-party spatial solutions to
develop enterprise-wide location intelligence.

SAP HANA includes base
maps with political boundaries and points of interest to accelerate
development of modern location-aware business applications. Third-party
spatial solutions can also use SAP HANA as a high-performance, in-memory
data store for managing and processing spatial data.

=== Graph

SAP HANA lets you store and process highly connected data using a
dynamic data model called property graph. Storing and querying graph
data is supported through SQL and the openCypher project’s Cypher query
language.

A graph provides full transactional consistency and guaranteed
ACID compliance without replicating live transaction data. Native graph
algorithms are provided to uncover relationships in your data in real
time.

You can also combine graph data processing with additional
advanced analytical processing functionality in SAP HANA, such as text
analytics, predictive, and spatial. The graph viewer delivered as part
of SAP HANA helps you visualize and explore graph data.

=== Predictive analytics and machine learning

Predictive analysis with SAP HANA includes native high-performance
predictive algorithms for both expert and automated modes.

Additionally,
you can run open-source R scripts on SAP HANA through integration with R
Server and build machine learning applications with integration to
TensorFlow.

Some of the predictive algorithms run on streaming, spatial,
and series data and are self-improving.

=== Search

You can use SQL to locate text quickly across multiple columns and
binary files, such as Adobe PDF files, HTML, RTF, MSG, Microsoft Office
documents, and flat text files. SAP HANA lets you run both full-text and
advanced fuzzy searches for 32 languages.

Text analytics in SAP HANA
include advanced natural-language processing and entity extraction
capabilities, such as segmentation, stemming, tagging, and sentiment
analysis.

SAP HANA also extracts what are often referred to as triples –
sequences of subject, verb, and object. These functionalities help
extract meaning from unstructured data and transform it into structured data for analysis.
SAP HANA also
supports text-mining algorithms to mine relevant keywords in a body of
documents.

=== Streaming analytics

You can capture and process streams of events from many sources in real
time using the highly scalable smart data streaming engine inside SAP
HANA.

SAP HANA supports an SQL-like processing language to combine
streams with contextual data and analyze the result on the fly.

To improve scalability, SAP HANA comes with a streaming-light component you
can deploy on the streaming data source to analyze and filter streams
before they reach SAP HANA.

=== Series data

Data from the Internet of Things and data from sensors arrive in a
time-series format.

SAP HANA processes time-series data and other kinds of series data efficiently to
discover trends over a period.

=== Document store

SAP HANA lets you build enterprise-class non-SQL (NoSQL) applications
with the support to store schema-flexible data in JSON format. You can
combine JSON data with structured data and query or analyze it using
SQL.

=== Data integration, replication, and quality

SAP HANA supports comprehensive features to handle all data integration
scenarios. These include real-time data replication as well as bulk-load
processing, data transformation, cleansing services, and data enrichment
services.

Adapters are available for loading data from several
databases, cloud sources, and Apache Hadoop, along with a custom
software development kit for building your own adapters.

=== Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark integration

SAP HANA provides multiple options to analyze Apache Hadoop data,
including the SAP Vora engine, SAP Cloud Platform Big Data Services, an
Apache Spark adapter, and Apache Hive.

You can access data in the Hadoop
distributed file system and access MapReduce functions as data sources
in SQL using user-defined virtual functions.

=== Free developer version

SAP HANA, express edition, a free developer version of SAP HANA, is
http://sap.com/sap-hana-express[available to get started with]
developing applications on SAP HANA.

The express edition is limited to
32GB of memory, but apart from that and a few enterprise features, it
offers the full range of functions available in SAP HANA. SAP HANA,
express edition can be run on-premise by installing the binaries
directly, by running a virtual machine containing the binaries, or by
running a Docker image.

SAP HANA, express edition is also available in the cloud via the
https://cal.sap.com/[SAP Cloud Appliance Library (AWS r Microsoft Azure)], the
https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/sap-public/sap-hana-express[Google]
https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/sap-public/sap-hana-express[Cloud Platform], or the
https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/sap.hanaexpress[Microsoft Azure Marketplace].

== You've been providing many improvements to the SAP HANA Hibernate Dialect. Is Hibernate a good fit when working with SAP HANA?

Yes, Hibernate works really well with SAP HANA. Over the course of my
research, I haven’t found a project that’s as popular as Hibernate and
provides the same range of features. Furthermore, these features each
complement specific SAP HANA capabilities.

First of all, the core dialect provides the necessary flexibility to
deal with the unavoidable differences between databases regarding the
SQL syntax.

On top of that, Hibernate offers interesting extensions that
work really well with SAP HANA. One such example is the Hibernate
Spatial dialect that can be used to process geospatial data leveraging
SAP HANA’s advanced geospatial engine. SAP HANA’s text search and
analysis features can be consumed via the Hibernate Search project.

And when working with SAP HANA’s NoSQL capabilities, there is the Hibernate
OGM project that can be extended to work with the SAP HANA graph engine
and the SAP HANA document store.

In my opinion, Hibernate is a perfect fit for building advanced
transactional and analytical applications on SAP HANA because it
provides interfaces for the most important SAP HANA capabilities thereby
allowing the developers to consume these capabilities from within their
familiar domain without having to care too much about the database
specifics.

== Since you've been fixing various issues in Hibernate ORM, what was your experience of contributing to the Hibernate ORM project? Is it easy for other developers to start contributing?

My experience contributing to the ORM project has been very positive.
The contribution process is simple and clearly described on the
Hibernate website and in the GitHub repository.

I especially like the fact that there is only a minimum amount of
licensing overhead to consider, so you can get started without
consulting a lawyer.

The contribution guidelines are clear, and there are resources available
that describe how to get started with popular IDEs complete with code
templates and formatters, thus making it easy to stick to the coding
conventions.

The Hibernate team regularly checks for new GitHub pull requests,
reviews them, and provides helpful feedback if necessary.

== We always value feedback from our community,  so can you tell us what features you'd like us to add to make easier for other data access frameworks to integrate with JPA or Hibernate?

Overall, I’m very happy with the features provided by Hibernate.
I’ve been able to implement all the features I needed one way or another.
So really, I can’t complain, but since you asked...

One thing that I’ve come across while implementing the Hibernate dialect
for SAP HANA is that sometimes it would be helpful to have a way of
adapting the SQL query generation that’s being done by Hibernate to add
database-specific syntax. As far as I’ve understood, reworking the SQL
query generation is a major topic for Hibernate 6, so I’m looking
forward to that.

Another interesting feature would be the ability to easily influence not
only the SQL query generation but also the schema generation. That way,
even the database schema could be tailored to the specific database,
possibly leveraging database-specific features not included in standard
SQL.
