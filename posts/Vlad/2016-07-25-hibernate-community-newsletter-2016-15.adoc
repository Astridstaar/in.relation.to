Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

* Multitenancy is a very useful enterprise application requirement, and Java EE might add support for it in a future release.
Luckily, Hibernate already supports it, and Andr√© William Prade Hildinger shows you how you can use the https://www.toptal.com/hibernate/build-multitenant-java-hibernate[Hibernate schema-based multitenancy support in production].
* In fact, https://leanpub.com/high-performance-java-persistence/read#leanpub-auto-jpa-vs-hibernate[Hibernate offers many features that are not yet supported in JPA].
* Anghel Leonard, who is a well-known https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/anghel-leonard[book author] and JSF contributor, wrote three articles:
** http://java-ee-articles.blogspot.ro/2016/07/data-table-pagination-via-primeng.html[How to implement table pagination with Spring MVC, Hibernate, and PrimeNG]
** http://java-ee-articles.blogspot.ro/2016/07/hibernate-logging-with-datasource-proxy.html[How to log statements with Hibernate and datasource-proxy]
** http://java-ee-articles.blogspot.ro/2016/07/asserting-sql-statement-count-generated.html[How to assert the SQL statement count with Hibernate]
* Hibernate Spatial is now bundled as a `hibernate-spatial` module dependency, and if you plan to use it, then you must check http://blog.disy.net/geodatabase-comparison-mysql-mssql-sql-anywhere/[how various relational databases support spatial queries].
* Bozhidar Bozhanov wrote a very good http://techblog.bozho.net/spring-managed-hibernate-event-listeners/[article about Spring-managed Hibernate Event Listeners].
* On our blog, we documented http://in.relation.to/2016/07/19/null-andnot-null-discriminator-values/[how you can use `null` and `not-null` with `@DiscriminatorValue` to accommodate various legacy database inheritance mappings].
* We also documented how you can detect connection leaks with https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-detect-database-connection-leaks/[this very useful utility] which helped us http://in.relation.to/2016/07/14/how-we-fixed-all-database-connection-leaks/[find all leaks in our test suite].
* http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-common-performance-problems-in-logs[3 Common Hibernate Performance Issues and How to Find Them in Your Log File] is a very interesting article on Baeldung.
* Thorben Janssen shows you http://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-tips-use-custom-sequence/[how to use a custom database sequence with Hibernate]. If you're using sequences, you should be using https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-hidden-gem-the-pooled-lo-optimizer/[the `pooled` ot the `pooled-lo` optimizer to boost Hibernate write performance].
* https://vladmihalcea.com/jpa-persist-and-merge/[How does persist and merge work in JPA and Hibernate] is an article I was planning on writing for a long time because it features the `Redundant-Save Anti-Pattern` as well.
