Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

* A very good introduction to http://blog.anthavio.net/2016/03/join-unrelated-entities-in-jpa.html[Ad-hoc join queries] by Martin Vaněk. This feature is supported by Hibernate since version 5.1.0, so one more reason to upgrade.
* Although not a recent one, it's worth mentioning Konrad Garus's article about http://squirrel.pl/blog/2015/10/07/rapid-development-with-hibernate-in-cqrs-read-models/[Rapid Development with Hibernate in CQRS Read Models].
* http://marxsoftware.blogspot.com/2015/07/using-hibernate-bean-validator-java-se.html[How to use Hibernate Bean Validator in a Java SE project] by Dustin Marx is also a very good read.
* In case you want to call an Oracle stored procedure or a function, I wrote http://vladmihalcea.com/2016/03/22/how-to-call-oracle-stored-procedures-and-functions-from-hibernate/[a guide] about how you can do it from Hibernate.
