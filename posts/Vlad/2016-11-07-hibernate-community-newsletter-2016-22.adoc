Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

If you are using a specific database catalog and schema,
then you should definitely know about https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-resolve-the-hibernate-global-database-schema-and-catalog-for-native-sql-queries/[this little Hibernate trick to resolve the currently used catalog and schema from within any native SQL query].

One very good article that I found is this 2009 paper, https://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/jbw/jmlodgenski_940_scaling_hibernate.pdf[Scaling Hibernate Applications with Postgres] which is still relevant today.

If you plan on using PostgreSQL table partitioning with Hibernate, check out https://blog.akquinet.de/2015/08/04/postgresql-partitioned-tables-and-hibernate/[this post for some very good tips].

Thorben Janssen wrote an article about http://www.thoughts-on-java.org/6-hibernate-features-im-missing-jpa[6 Hibernate features] that are not yet supported by JPA.
