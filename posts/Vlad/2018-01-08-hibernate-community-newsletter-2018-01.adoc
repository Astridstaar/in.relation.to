Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

While unit testing is great for testing classes that have a certain logic that's well encapsulated,
testing data access logic code requires integration testing because you want to see how queries are executed on the same database server type
you are also using in production.
Emmanouil Gkatziouras wrote https://egkatzioura.com/2017/12/30/integration-tests-with-maven/[an article about running Integration Tests using Maven]
so you should definitely check it out if you are planning on starting a new project or the current project does not use any Integration Testing.

For our Japanese readers, Shin Watanabe wrote https://qiita.com/rubytomato@github/items/52e8067e41181eea70a2[an article about using the Hibernate-specific `ResultTransformer`]
when building the `ResultSet` of a projection query.

Simon Martinelli wrote two article about JPA which are definitely a good read:
