Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Presentations

Check out the Virtual JUG presentation about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smp96O7brmg[High-Performance Java Persistence and Hibernate].
If you are using a relational database, then you should definitely watch this session and learn how to run your enterprise application at warp speed.

== Articles

The `@Transactional` annotation allows for a clear separation between business logic and transaction handling.
However, just because you are using a very convenient abstraction, it does not mean you don't have to understand how it works behind the scenes.
Check out the
http://blog.jhades.org/how-does-spring-transactional-really-work["how does Spring @Transactional really work"]
article from jHades to know more on this topic.

If you're using Payara Java EE Application Server and want to make it work with Hibernate 5,
then you should definitely check out http://blog.payara.fish/using-hibernate-5-on-payara-server[this tutorial].

I also wrote three articles that cover JPA 2.2 Date and Time types, Hibernate Array types, as well as CDC using http://debezium.io/[Debezium].
