Thorben Janssen wrote a http://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-envers-getting-started/[Getting Started article for Hibernate Envers]
and another one about http://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-envers-query-data-audit-log/[querying audit log entries].

Dimo Velev gives http://dimovelev.blogspot.ro/2015/02/performance-pitfalls-hibernate-criteria.html[a very detailed explanation] of why `Class.forName` can cause lock contention.

and https://vladmihalcea.com/2016/12/14/the-performance-penalty-of-class-forname-when-parsing-jpql-and-criteria-queries/[the fix will be available starting from Hibernate ORM 5.2.6].

If you want to use Hibernate ORM with SQL Server, then you should read http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Hibernate/148907/[this article].
There are plenty of tips related to optimal data access patterns and indexing considerations.

Jakub Kubrynski explains http://www.kubrynski.com/2016/12/why-should-you-care-about-equals-and.html[why you should care about equals and hashCode],
especially when dealing with JPA entities.

[SQL injection attacks are real](https://vladmihalcea.com/2016/11/08/a-beginners-guide-to-sql-injection-and-how-you-should-prevent-it/),
and http://blog.h3xstream.com/2014/02/hql-for-pentesters.html[HQL and JPQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL Injection] if String concatenation is being used.
