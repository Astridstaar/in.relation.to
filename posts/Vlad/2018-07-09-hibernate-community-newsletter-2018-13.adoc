Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are
especially relevant to our users.

== Videos

If you are using Spring Boot, you should definitely check out https://spring.io/blog/2018/06/06/spring-tips-jpa[this video] from Josh Long
where he shares several tips about JPA, Spring, and Hibernate.

== Articles

When using Hibernate, the impact of JPQL query parsing might be overlooked.
However, as explained
https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-query-plan-cache/[in this article],
it is very important to make sure that the Query Cache Plan can handle the vast majority of JPQL and Criteria API queries.

If you are planning on using Spring Boot with Hibernate ORM and Hibernate Search,
then you should definitely read
https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2018/04/spring-hibernate-tutorial.html[this tutorial].

For our Chinese readers,
https://juejin.im/post/5b3ca5386fb9a04fd34370d2[this article] shows some interesting problems that Lombok can cause when using JPA and Hibernate.

When using a relational database, most applications rely on the default isolation level, which, most often,
is either Read Committed (e.g. Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) or Repeatable Read (e.g. MySQL, MariaDB).
However, none of these default isolation levels can prevent the Phantom Read anomaly.
For more details about this phenomenon and how you can prevent it, check out
https://vladmihalcea.com/phantom-read/[this article].

In
https://medium.com/@paul.klingelhuber/hibernate-dirty-checking-with-converted-attributes-1b6d1cd27f68[this article],
Paul Klingelhuber explains how entity attributes annotated with `@Convert` are handled by the Hibernate dirty checking mechanism.
