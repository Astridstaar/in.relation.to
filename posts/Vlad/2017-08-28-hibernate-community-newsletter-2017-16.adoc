== Articles

Brandur has written https://brandur.org/postgres-atomicity[a very detailed explanation]
about the implementation of MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) in PostgreSQL.
For a beginner's overview of what MVCC is and how it works,
check out https://vladmihalcea.com/2017/03/01/how-does-mvcc-multi-version-concurrency-control-work/[this article] as well.

Hibernate Envers is probably the easiest way to set up an audit log if you are already using JPA and Hibernate.
Check out https://vladmihalcea.com/2017/08/22/the-best-way-to-implement-an-audit-log-using-hibernate-envers/[this article]
to see the best audit strategy to use when choosing Envers as your audit log implementation.

Running out of database sequence values is a very serious issue.
https://hackernoon.com/the-night-the-postgresql-ids-ran-out-9430a2dbb895[This article] explains how this had happened on a production system, and
offers both a quick fix and a solution for this problem.

Not only that it provides a solid implementation of the JPA specification,
but Hibernate can be used for all sorts of tasks like for getting access to the binding between JPA entities
and the underlying DB objects (e.g. table, column).
Check out https://vladmihalcea.com/2017/08/24/how-to-get-the-entity-mapping-to-database-table-binding-metadata-from-hibernate/[this article]
for more details on this topic.

https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-tips-elementcollection/[This article] explains how to persist a `List` of `String` objects as an `@ElementCollection`.
Although simple, `@ElementCollection`, like any unidirectional association, is
https://vladmihalcea.com/2015/05/04/how-to-optimize-unidirectional-collections-with-jpa-and-hibernate/[not very efficient].
A https://vladmihalcea.com/2017/03/29/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-association-with-jpa-and-hibernate/[bidirectional `@OneToMany`] association
where the `String` element becomes part of the Child entity
is a much more efficient alternative.
