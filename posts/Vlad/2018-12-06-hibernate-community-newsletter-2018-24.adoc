Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

In https://medium.com/@manika09singh/hibernate-mistakes-to-avoid-f1636e4ee1d7[this article],
Manika Singh shows 7 mistakes you should avoid when using JPA and Hibernate.

If you want to execute a custom SQL function from a JPQL or Criteria API query,
it's best to register the function so that Hibernate knows how to pass arguments and map the return value.
https://vladmihalcea.com/sql-functions-multiple-parameters-jpql-hibernate/[This article] explains how you can
register an SQL function which can take parameters from the executing `Query` or reference the underlying
table columns via the entity properties in the JPQL query.

https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-hibernate-difference[This article] explains the difference between
the JPA standard and the Hibernate framework which implements the Java Persistence specification.

If you're using PostgreSQL and want to map Java Enums to the PostgreSQL-specific Enum types,
https://www.javaadvent.com/2018/12/how-to-map-postgresql-enums-to-jpa-entity-properties-using-hibernate.html[this article] explains how you can do that without even having to write a new custom Hibernate Type.

For our Portuguese readers,
http://naweb.info/o-que-e-o-problema-das-queries-n1-sql-banco-de-dados-terminologia/[this article]
explains what the N+1 query issue is and how you can overcome it when using JPA and Hibernate.

The `org.hibernate.Hibernate` utility class defines an `initialize` method which takes an entity or a collection
proxy and forces the proxy initialization. However, this is only useful if the proxy can be fetched from the second-level cache. If the proxy initialization triggers a database query, then it's much more efficient
to simply fetch the lazy association with the initial database query.

https://vladmihalcea.com/initialize-lazy-proxies-collections-jpa-hibernate/[this article].

Debezium is an open-source framework which allows you to extract CDC (Change Data Capture) events from the database log and consume them either via an embeddable driver or using Kafka.
https://debezium.io/blog/2018/12/05/automating-cache-invalidation-with-change-data-capture/[This article]
explains how you can use Debezium to detect database changes that happen outside of Hibernate
and invalidate the second-level cache entries associated with the recently changed table rows.

Hibernate is a very customizable framework, and because you can override the default CRUD statements,
it's very easy to implement a https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-soft-delete-with-hibernate/[soft delete mechanism] which allows you to retain deleted entities in the database, but to hide them in the application
after they were logically deleted.
https://thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-tips-exclude-deactivated-elements-from-association/[This article] shows you
got to exclude deleted entities from a given association.

== Time to upgrade

There were two releases for the Hibernate ORM project:

- http://in.relation.to/2018/11/29/hibernate-orm-540-cr2-out/[Hibernate ORM 5.4.0 CR2] is the second release candidate for the 5.4 branch. We are looking forward to getting your feedback for this release.
- The http://in.relation.to/2018/11/28/hibernate-orm-5117-final-release/[Hibernate ORM 5.1.17] release provides bug fixes and improvements for the 5.1 branch. If you are using Hibernate ORM 5.1, you should upgrade to benefit from the latest enhancements.

There were two releases for Hibernate Search project as well:

- http://in.relation.to/2018/11/29/hibernate-search-6-0-0-Alpha1/[Hibernate Search 6.0.0 Aplha1] is the first release for the 6th major version of this project. Although this version is not suitable for production due to its limitations and to the fact APIs are still unstable, itâ€™s a great way to get a feeling of where Hibernate Search is going and provide your feedback.
- http://in.relation.to/2018/12/05/hibernate-search-5-11-0-CR1/[Hibernate Search 5.11.0 CR1] is  the first candidate release for the 5.11 branch, and it mainly includes an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.0.CR2.
