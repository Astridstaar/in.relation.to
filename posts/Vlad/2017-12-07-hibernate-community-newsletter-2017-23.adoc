Welcome to the Hibernate community newsletter in which we share blog posts, forum, and StackOverflow questions that are especially relevant to our users.

== Articles

The pick of this newsletter is
http://lifeinide.com/post/2015-09-19-avoid-subclasses-join-in-hibernate/[this article from Łukasz Frankowski]
about selecting just the superclasses using JPQL and Hibernate.

To develop Hibernate, most of the developers in our team use IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains,
which, apart from being one of the best Java IDEs,
it also provides https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/jpa-and-hibernate.html[very good support for JPA and Hibernate].

For our Spanish readers,
Rodrigo Martins wrote an article about
https://atitudereflexiva.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/a-melhor-forma-de-mapear-um-relacionamento-onetoone-com-jpa/[the best way to map a `@OneToOne` association with JPA and Hibernate].

Besides implementing the JPA specification,
Hibernate comes with many additional features like the `@JoinFormula` annotation which allows you to
https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-map-a-jpa-manytoone-relationship-to-a-sql-query-using-the-hibernate-joinformula-annotation/[map a `@ManyToOne` association based on the result of a certain native SQL query].

Or, you can map immutable entities, as described in
http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-immutable[this article on Baeldung].

On our blog, you can read more about the
http://in.relation.to/2017/11/28/introducing-hibernate-search-jsr352-mass-indexing-job/[new JSR 352-compliant Hibernate Search Mass Indexer]
which is supported by Hibernate Search 5.9.

== Time to upgrade

http://in.relation.to/2017/11/27/hibernate-search-5-9-0-Beta1/[Hibernate Search 5.9.0-Beta1] has been released.
If you want to give it a try, feedback is highly appreciated.
