DZone did a short <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/contexts-and-dependency" target="" class="regularLink">interview</a> with <a href="http://nostacktrace.com/" target="" class="regularLink">me</a> to go along with the recently released <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/contexts-and-depencency" target="" class="regularLink">CDI Refcard</a>.  It's a bit on the short side, but it's a good concise overview of CDI for developers who might not get what it's all about yet.  Enjoy!</p>
