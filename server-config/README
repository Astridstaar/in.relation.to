When making changes to the redirect rules or other Apache HTTPD configuration files,
these are not applied automatically by the Jenkins build job which
normally publishes new blog posts.

You have to invoke the deploy script to upload and restart HTTPD:

 > source ./deploy.sh

You can invoke this locally - from your workstation - but it assumes
that you have SSH console credentials in place to get a shell on `ci.hibernate.org`.

Your private key needs to be used in combination with user "ec2-user".

A typical .ssh/config file would look like:

Host ci.hibernate.org
   User ec2-user
   VerifyHostKeyDNS no
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Possibly change to your key!
   IdentitiesOnly yes
   AddressFamily inet
   Compression yes
   ForwardAgent no
   ForwardX11 no
